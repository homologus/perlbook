# From Associative Array to Dictionary


Associative arrays in PERL are called dictionaries in Python.

Here is a PERL program using an associative array.

~~~~~~~~
%A = ("john", 39, "mark", 170);

print $A{"john"},"\n";	
print %A,"\n";
~~~~~~~~


Its equivalent Python code is shown below.

~~~~~~~~
A = {'john': 12, 'mark': 170}

print A['john']
print A
