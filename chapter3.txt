# Numbers and Variables

A> ## In a nutshell
A>
A> Unlike PERL, Python does not use '$', '%' and '@' in front of names of variables.


Apart from '$', '%' and '@' symbols in front of the names, PERL and Python variables are named in the same way. Here are two equivalent PERL and Python programs -

~~~~~~~~
$x=10;
$y=2*$x;
print "$y\n";
$y=$y+1;
print "$y\n";	
~~~~~~~~


~~~~~~~~
x=10
y=2*x
print y
y=y+1
print y	
~~~~~~~~


Apart from the steps listed in the previous chapter, there are no differences between the two programs.

We also note that the mathematical operators are identical in PERL and Python. They are shown in the following table.


| Operator   | Action   |
|-----------|----------|
| + |  Addition    |
| - |  Subtraction    |
| * |  Multiplication    |
| / |  Division    |
| % |  Remainder    |
| ** |  Power    |
